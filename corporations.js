// nations may give up stock in their corporation through three methods, random events firing selling small amounts
// of stock a country owns, a nation choosing to sell stock to get money quickly for instance in a war, or high
// government corruption causing random events to pop selling large amounts of stock. When stock is sold it gets sold
// back to the corporation, who have to give up 50% the value of the stock, but then get to sell it to the highest bidder.
// All nations on the planet have the chance to bid on the stock, after 6 months it get sold to the highest bidder, and
// the corporation receives all money from the sale. Because corporations only have to pay half the value of the stock
// when it gets sold back to them, a nation can give its corporation more money by simply buying and selling its own
// stock back and forth, this system is designed to be abused, because it opens up the country to losing its stock
// if another bidder comes along and tries to take it from them, and that makes things interesting.
