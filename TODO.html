- allow units to be embarked and disembarked

- allow units to be disembarked even if their HTML elemnt is not on the page at the moment

- make it so that ships have to get added into a fleet before you can embark land units into that fleet, and making ANY
- change to the composition of a fleet with the sliders results in all land units being disembarked, forcing the player to
- first decide on the size of the fleet he wants, and then embark units onto the established fleet. Closing
- the fleet window should ALSO result in all land units disembarking

- make sure that moving armies out of a city closes that city window otherwise it may be possible to select an army which no longer
- exists in the interface thus causing an error

- allow units to be put into armies and fleets

- allow armies and fleets to travel around the map with embarked units contained inside them

- Add in monthly maintenance costs for all owned units after resource production but before total resource tabulation that goes to
- the player's screen

- create Space Control GUI screen

- Create Land Combat

- Make Railguns have less health but more damage and cheaper construction cost and missiles have signifcantly more health because destroying missile bunkers
- would be harder than destroying a large railgun in real life

- allow ranged weapons to attack non-orbital military units

- allow military units to capture cities

- Allow players to zoom the map out (fabricjs tutorial part 5)

- allow pausing time and the game

- add fullscreen option for the game which automatically F11s the screen to fullscreen

- Add corporations

- add country legder and internal controls screen

- add country interactions screen for diplomacy

- Modify the Bankruptcy function in common-functions so that all corporate stock gets sold on Bankruptcy

- Add message alerts to a sidebar letting the player know production stopped when they run out of a resource and
- what resource is needed to continue production. Also create player alerts when they enter or leave bankruptcy, and
- enter or leave starvation

- Create Naval Combat

- Create Provinces borders and province view (goal August 2021)

- add orbital mechanics and units

- allow ranged weapons to attack orbital units (runBuildingProcesses2.js near the bottom)

- add government interactions and internal politics

- add Unions

- Add unrest/rebel mechanics and rebel popping

- Create AI triggers to start producing or buying a resource when they are producing something and that resource runs out

- Make it so that once a year when technology is being calculated the code checks every country to see if they have a research facility
- and sets their 'hasResearchFacility' property to true or false if they have one in any owned city, after this their may be a random
- chance of them discovering a new technology

- Add diplomatic interactions screen for countries

- Add Economic Control and internal policies menu that you can get to by clicking any resources in the top bar

- Add a main menu that you can get to by clicking the world clock

- Add world saving

- make the screen movable by clicking and dragging

- Create Geostationary space zones that you can put Solar Satellites into, make it so only a limited number of Solar Satellites
- can exist in each zone and only certain countries have building rights. Maybe 6 or 8 zones per world

- maybe experiment with disabling object caching and see how that goes (main2.js)
