- create removeFromArmy function for all land units

- give guerrillas an ideology alliance attribute

- create slider functions and make sure they disembark when activated

- maybe change morale to be based on army and fleet and not by unit then figure out how that would factor into city combat

- create fleet elemnts on canvas and give them the ability to move around

- create ranged weapon targeting of closest fleets and armies

- create land unit elements on canvas

- create aircraft combat mechanics

- make sure that moving armies out of a city closes that city window otherwise it may be possible to select an army which no longer
- exists in the interface thus causing an error

- maybe remove the ability to move guerilla armies from index.php?

- armies should know what country they are in by looking at the color of the pixel they are on, the default map color should be
- fully brown, and in areas with hilly terrain the color of the province controller should be partially transparent so the brown
- shows through, then armies will determine if they are in hilly terrain based on the transparency of the pixel, but the raw color
- will still match the controlling country

- Add in monthly maintenance costs for all owned units after resource production but before total resource tabulation that goes to
- the player's screen

- create Space Control GUI screen

- Create Land Combat

- create land attrition

- if a land army takes too much attrition for it to handle (like in mountains or with a HUGE stack) half of it will break and dissappear
- and the units will re-appear in the last city they came from in their '.cityID' property

- Make Railguns have less health but more damage and cheaper construction cost and missiles have signifcantly more health because destroying missile bunkers
- would be harder than destroying a large railgun in real life

- allow military units to capture cities

- Allow players to zoom the map out (fabricjs tutorial part 5)

- allow pausing time and the game

- add fullscreen option for the game which automatically F11s the screen to fullscreen

- Add corporations

- Add corporation screen

- add country legder and internal controls screen

- add country interactions screen for diplomacy

- Modify the Bankruptcy function in common-functions so that all corporate stock gets sold on Bankruptcy

- Add message alerts to a sidebar letting the player know production stopped when they run out of a resource and
- what resource is needed to continue production. Also create player alerts when they enter or leave bankruptcy, and
- enter or leave starvation

- Create Naval Combat

- Create Provinces borders and province view (goal August 2021)

- add orbital mechanics and units

- allow ranged weapons to attack orbital units (runBuildingProcesses2.js near the bottom)

- add government interactions and internal politics

- add Unions

- Add unrest/rebel mechanics and rebel popping

- Create AI triggers to start producing or buying a resource when they are producing something and that resource runs out

- Make it so that once a year when technology is being calculated the code checks every country to see if they have a research facility
- and sets their 'hasResearchFacility' property to true or false if they have one in any owned city, after this their may be a random
- chance of them discovering a new technology

- Add diplomatic interactions screen for countries

- Add Economic Control and internal policies menu that you can get to by clicking any resources in the top bar

- Add a main menu that you can get to by clicking the world clock

- Add world saving

- make the screen movable by clicking and dragging

- Create Geostationary space zones that you can put Solar Satellites into, make it so only a limited number of Solar Satellites
- can exist in each zone and only certain countries have building rights. Maybe 6 or 8 zones per world

- maybe experiment with disabling object caching and see how that goes (main2.js)



======================================= DLC ===================================================================

==============================================================================================================








===== Trade Mechanics =============================================================================================
- Every country can send resources out every month or every other month

- Only major Trade Powers can suck resources in and give money to the countries that sold them those resources
- this means that instead of multiplying 200 X 200 when looking for trade partners on a planet, you will only have
- to multiply 200 X 10 so it is easier on the computer, large countries can fight over becoming a trade Power
- and this can become a source of tension between large nations

- When a small country sends resources out, it choose a random country in one of the 10 Trade Powers to send the resources
- to. If the country is a land neighbor then no ships is sent and the trade is instant. When the ship reaches a port belonging
- to the trade power, the small nation receives money directly from the corporation of that nation. Corporations in turn
- can liquidate resources when they have too much of them for 10% more than they bought them for, so although the corporation
- might lose money in the short term, they gain money in the long run.

- If a country does not have a corporation, the government pays for the resources and gets them instead of the corporation
- but they can only liquidate them for 2% higher than market value.
======================================================================================================================



==== Factions ========================================================================================================
- Factions will be intertwined with Government, some countries will have multiple competing factions, while others
- may have only one powerful faction due to government type, corruption, or events. Events
- will often fire regarding factions, when factions are small and competing many of these events will only effect
- the relative power of each faction in their struggle with one another, as one faction becomes more and more powerful
- the events for that faction will start to have more negative effects for the country while the smaller faction
- will simply try to gain more power. Having a single large faction should generally be a bad thing but the faction
- system should be mostly self balancing. Faction events should be one of the mainways countries lose corporation shares

- Corporations can pick a side and prop up factions within a country. Usually a corporation only exists at the mercy of its
- owner nation but this is a chance for the corporation to help or hurt its host nation.

- Factions will feature heavily in government mechanics, most mechanics within a government should be tied to a faction
- in one way or another. This is another way to punish nations that only have one faction.
