// For a province to become autnomos or need to be kept as a vassal or satellite, at least two factors must be at play:
// it must be on another continent, another majority Ethnicity, another majority Ideology, or in Space. A space
// colony can still be directly controlled with the right policies, but at the cost of increased autonomy in all
// terrestrial provinces
